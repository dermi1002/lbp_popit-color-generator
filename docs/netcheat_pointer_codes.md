# How Cheat Codes Work

The NetCheat List files generated by the LittleBigPlanet Popit Color Generator use a single pointer that leads to all the addresses to the Popit Color values. 

This pointer is found via the following:
- Searching for a Popit Color value in-game through a memory editor 4-byte scan and finding a temporary address that links to it
- Searching for that temporary address as a value through a memory editor pointer scan and finding a pointer that links to it
- If done correctly, the pointer would include the Popit Color value within it.
