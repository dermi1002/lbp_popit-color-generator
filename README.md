# LittleBigPlanet Popit Color Generator - Class Test
The ultimage goal is to turn a "Color Tab" frame into a tamplate Class to be repeated in all four tabs of Popit Color Values. This would benefit developers from having to find unorganized frames to apply features.

What are the consequences?

## UPDATE: The test is a success! The program seemingly works with no consequences, and will be moved to the main repo with a pre-relase plan!

## Current Issues:
- [x] ~~I did just that, then uncommented the functions for the ColorTab. Although the one for copying the entry displaying the color's hex value, the other that changes the preview square's color doesn't.~~
- [x] ~~I turned the function colorTab back into a class, ColorTab. It seems that any frame that isn't set under the master of the object is basically ignored and the grid system is different than normally. Frames that have been placed under the master are placed inside the Tabview, which is great news to me! Since every element is pretty much placed in a grid system, I'll replace it with a pack or place system and set them under the master later. I can't get my hopes up easily though.~~
- [x] ~~I changed ColorTab into a function, colorTab, and placed it inside the ColorTabList class. The program can open, but when an instance is called, it's placed outside the class. Why is that?~~
- [x] ~~The class ColorTabList doesn't have the attribute tk. Maybe that also needs to be a function or moved into the main window?????~~
- [x] ~~The class ColorTab is not callable. Perhaps it should be a function instead?~~
