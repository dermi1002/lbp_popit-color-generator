# LittleBigPlanet Popit Color Generator - Class Test
The ultimage goal is to turn a "Color Tab" frame into a tamplate Class to be repeated in all four tabs of Popit Color Values. This would benefit developers from having to find unorganized frames to apply features.

What are the consequences?

## Current Issues:
- [ ] I changed ColorTab into a function, colorTab, and placed it inside the ColorTabList class. The program can open, but when an instance is called, it's placed outside the class. Why is that?
- [x] ~~The class ColorTabList doesn't have the attribute tk. Maybe that also needs to be a function or moved into the main window?????~~
- [x] ~~The class ColorTab is not callable. Perhaps it should be a function instead?~~
