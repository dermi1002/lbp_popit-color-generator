# LittleBigPlanet Popit Color Generator - Class Test
The ultimage goal is to turn a "Color Tab" frame into a tamplate Class to be repeated in all four tabs of Popit Color Values. This would benefit developers from having to find unorganized frames to apply features.

What are the consequences?

## Current Issues:
- [ ] The class ColorTabList doesn't have the attribute tk. Maybe that also needs to be a function or moved into the main window?????
- [x] ~~The class ColorTab is not callable. Perhaps it should be a function instead?~~
